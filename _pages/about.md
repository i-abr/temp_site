I am a Post-doctoral fellow at <a href="https://www.ri.cmu.edu/">The Robotics Institute at Carnegie Mellon University</a>. I will be starting as an Assistant Professor in Mechanical Engineering at Yale University in January 22'. 

I obtained my Ph.D. at Northwestern University in the <a href="https://robotics.northwestern.edu/">Center for Robotics and Biosystems</a>. During my Ph.D. I interned at the <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/research/robotics/">NVIDIA Seattle Robotics Lab</a> where I worked on model-based control for kitchen robotics. I was also a part of the <a href="https://www.darpa.mil/work-with-us/offensive-swarm-enabled-tactics">DARPA FX-3 Urban Swarm Challenge</a> where I implemented my decentralized ergodic control work on a swarm of field robots. I am also the recipient of the 2019 T-RO best paper award for my work on active learning for linear representations of nonlinear systems. I was also awarded the Belytschko Outstanding Research Award for my thesis work on optimal experimental learning for robotic systems. 



Research
======

My research is focused on the development of active runtime learning techniques for robotic systems. Ultimately, my goal is to enhance robotic systems to be self-sufficient and adaptive with minimal human intervention.
