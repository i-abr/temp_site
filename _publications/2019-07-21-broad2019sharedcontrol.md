We present a data-driven shared control algorithm that can be used to improve a human operator’s control of complex
dynamic machines and achieve tasks that would otherwise be challenging, or impossible, for the user on their own. Our
method assumes no a priori knowledge of the system dynamics. Instead, both the dynamics and information about the user’s
interaction are learned from observation through the use of a Koopman operator.
