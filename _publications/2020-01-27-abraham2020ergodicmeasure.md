This paper develops KL-Ergodic Exploration from Equilibrium (KL-E 3 ), a method for robotic systems to integrate
stability into actively generating informative measurements through ergodic exploration. Ergodic exploration enables
robotic systems to indirectly sample from informative spatial distributions globally, avoiding local optima, and
without the need to evaluate the derivatives of the distribution against the robot dynamics.
