Although a number of solutions exist for the problems of coverage, search and target localization—commonly addressed
separately—whether there exists a unified strategy that addresses these objectives in a coherent manner without being
application-specific remains a largely open research question. In this paper, we develop a receding-horizon ergodic
control approach, based on hybrid systems theory, that has the potential to fill this gap.
