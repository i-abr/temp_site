Rodents tactually explore the environment using ~62 whiskers (vibrissae), regularly arranged in arrays on both sides of
the face. The rat vibrissal system is one of the most commonly used models to study how the brain encodes and processes
somatosensory information. To date, however, researchers have been unable to quantify the mechanosensory input at the
base of each whisker, because the field lacks accurate models of three-dimensional whisker dynamics. To close this gap,
we developed WHISKiT Physics, a simulation framework that incorporates realistic morphology of the full rat whisker
array to predict time-varying mechanical signals for all whiskers.
