We develop an algorithm to explore an environment to generate a measurement model for use in future localization tasks.
Ergodic exploration with respect to the likelihood of a particular class of measurement (eg, a contact detection
measurement in tactile sensing) enables construction of the measurement model. Exploration with respect to the
information density based on the data-driven measurement model enables localization.
