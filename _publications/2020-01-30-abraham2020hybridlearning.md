We develop a hybrid control approach for robot learning based on combining learned predictive models with
experience-based state-action policy mappings to improve the learning capabilities of robotic systems. Hybrid control
tools are used to create an algorithmic approach for combining learned predictive models with experience-based learning.
Hybrid learning is presented as a method for efficiently learning motor skills by systematically combining and improving
the performance of predictive models and experience- based policies.
