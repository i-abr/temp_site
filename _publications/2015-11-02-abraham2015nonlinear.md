Despite the neuromechanical complexity underlying animal locomotion, the steady-state center-of-mass motions and ground
reaction forces of animal running can be predicted by simple spring-mass models such as the canonical spring-loaded
inverted pendulum (SLIP) model. Here, we develop a leg damping model that is bilinear in leg length and velocity in
order to yield improved damping force and ground reaction force prediction.
