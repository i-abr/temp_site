This paper explores the application of Koopman operator theory to the control of robotic systems. The Koopman operator
takes any observation of state at time t and evolves the functions of state subject to its dynamics forward in time
linearly. Thus, a nonlinear dynamical system which has a discoverable Koopman operator can be represented by a linear
Koopman operator in a lifted function space where the observations of state evolve linearly. We illustrate how the
operator can be used to obtain a linearizable data-driven model of robotic systems for model-based control synthesis.
